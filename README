This script provides Debian systems with an init script for the
commercial Perforce server.  It is only any use if you have p4d
already.

The recommended way to build and install it is:
  $ dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us
  $ sudo dpkg -i ../p4bits_0.2_all.deb

By default the script assumes you keep your Perforce depot in
/var/lib/p4 and the p4d executable in /usr/local/bin.  However you can
reconfigure either by creating /etc/default/p4 and setting ROOT and
SERVER respectively.

See http://www.perforce.com/ for more information about Perforce.
